Markets were set to open in positive territory Wednesday morning, ahead of two key reports: The consumer price index and Disney earnings (more on both below). Investors 
are hoping for a rebound after all three major indices 
closed lower Tuesday. There are also a couple of Fed officials on 
the schedule Wednesday, both of whom could provide more clues about how the central bank is thinking about inflation and 
future rate increases. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
President Charles Evans is slated to speak at 11:00 am ET in Des Moines, while Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will talk later during 
a panel about stagflation at the Aspen Economic Strategy Group.
