The world’s richest person just secured himself some new funding. Elon Musk sold nearly $6.9 billion in 
Tesla stock between Friday and Tuesday, according to regulatory disclosures, months after he sold more than $8 billion in the company’s shares. At the time, in April, he said he 
didn’t plan any further share sales. Since then, though, he’s gotten himself into a court fight with Twitter over his decision to back out of his $
44 billion deal to buy the social network. Twitter is suing to force him to complete the deal. Musk was asked on Twitter Tuesday night whether he was done selling shares 
for the moment. He said “yes” and then added: “In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter 
forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don’t come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock.”
